//[Challenge] 1120 Callbacks, Async vs Sync & The Event Loop - Callbacks: https://coderacademyedu.github.io/resources/unit_callbacks.html

Challenge
Sometime we need random user data in our app. There's an app for that! Random User
1.	Save a copy of this file to your machine.
2.	Open the file in your editor.
3.	Examine the code. Think about what might happen when you run the file.
4.	Open the file in your browser to validate your expectations.
5.	With console open, refresh and you should see a response object after a second or two.
6.	Examine the response object in console, find the property which contains the response JSON.
7.	Update your console.log to log only the response JSON, not the entire object.
8.	Create a new function: parseRandomUser
9.	Update your code to use a callback i.e. pass getRandomUser the parseRandomUser function.
Your goal is to get parseRandomUser logging the random user details.
10.	Read about error-first callbacks. Can you implement error handling? The Random User request might not always respond the way we expect.
